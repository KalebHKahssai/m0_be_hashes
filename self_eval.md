# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

-- The notion keys vs values was a bit confusing at first, I needed to reread this section a couple of time, along with just syntax of symbols.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

-- Note taking has been a progression, I no longer take detailed notes on everything, but rather on concepts that don't make sense so I can look up latter, outside of that everything is general notes.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

-- I follow Mikes advice where I try to solve the problem for 30-60 minutes on my own before I Google or look for other resources.
